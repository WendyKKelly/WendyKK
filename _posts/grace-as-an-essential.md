This post perhaps ought to find its way onto my Explicit Christian site. I created an introduction video based on this idea on my YouTube channel.

I also dedicated this theme to my paid-subscriber newsletter over at [Underbelly](https://underbel.li).

What occurred to me as the day progressed and why I decided to end up here, is that I can't shake the truth that I have a voice and it needs to be heard.

Which feels really weird to write publicly but also is the essential element holding down all that I am doing right now.

In fact, something that occurred to me as I contemplated my plan moving forward is that I *want* to start a movement, as it were, of people who, moved by grace, moved by compassion, moved by trying to eek out a functional life in a dysfunctional world, feel not only okay with but compelled to speak.

We'll be polite — we can't help it.


## But Direct, Unflinching, and Kind

The world is filled with "too much content" — YES — but not enough "content" that is based around how to eek out a functional life in a dysfunctional world.

And that, my dear ones, is why I need to keep practicing. There are quite a few leaders out there: Russel Brand, Kate Bowler, Sara Billups, The couple behind the Wisdom of Trauma. More - certainly.

But it ocurred to me that there ought to be more. And so I am gearing up, practicing, giving it my best shot to give my voice to this project, as it were. 

## Functional in a Dysfunctional World

I have now spent a good nearly 54 years on this earth, raised by traumatised parents in a world that had pockets of kindness but was, frankly, scary as hell a lot of the time.

And, yes, I was (am) one of the lucky ones. 

I think that may be why I am able to speak on the subject. Not going to win any prizes on *how traumatized am I compared to you* but trauma aware enough and sensitive enough and educated enough to give voice to this subject. With a ton of humility born from humiliation transformed by grace.
