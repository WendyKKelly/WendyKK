Anyone who knows me at all would agree that I tend to dive into deep water around topics that interest me. I don't know why. Maybe I am ADHD, possibly "on the spectrum", easily have experienced a bit of hypomania. I don't know — just easier for me to file it all under "quirky" and move on.

In any case, this year has been interesting. There are a few threads that have converged. Social justice and activism have reared their gorgeous but untamed heads, counseling / therapy / mental health hold steady for my attention, web development took an awkward but interesting turn, and, not sure how it feels to call my faith and "interest" but my Christian faith is dead center (but not dead) in my life — and much bolder.
